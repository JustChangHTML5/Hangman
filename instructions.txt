If this is your first time playing hangman, here are some instructions on how to play the game:

At the start of each game, there will be a word or phrase that you have to guess.
Each turn, you can either guess one letter of the word or phrase or guess the entire word or phrase.
If you correctly guess a letter, it will be shown where in the word or phrase the letter is.
If you correctly guess the word or phrase, you win the game.
When guessing the word or phrase, enter everything including punctuation.
If you incorrectly guess a letter of the word or phrase or the entire word or phrase, one limb is added to the hangman.
Once the hangman is complete, you lose the game.
In my game, you only have 9 incorrect guesses you can make before the hangman is complete.
