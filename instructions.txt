If this is your first time playing hangman, here are some instructions on how to play the game:

At the start of each game, there will be a word or phrase that you have to guess.
Each turn, you can either guess one letter of the word or guess the entire word.
If you correctly guess a letter, it will be shown where in the word the letter is.
If you correctly guess the word, you win the game.
If you incorrectly guess a letter of word, one limb is added to the hangman.
Once the hangman is complete, you lose the game.
In my game, you only have 9 guesses before the hangman is complete.

If this is your first time playing this game, here are some controls:
Movement: w, a, s, d
Continue / Select: z
